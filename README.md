# dogem-coal
coal project

this project is a simple car dodging game implemented in x86 assembly language for the computer organization and assembly language (coal) course.

developed by me and [khadija rao](https://github.com/khadijarao1) as a team project.

the objective was to recreate a classic endless car game where the player controls a car to avoid oncoming obstacles/obstacle cars on the road.

features:
- player car movement (left/right using arrow keys)
- randomly generated moving obstacle cars
- scrolling road/background for illusion of speed
- score tracking based on bonus objects
- collision detection and game over
- basic graphics using dos interrupts

how to run:
1. assemble the .asm file using an 8086 assembler
2. run the executable in dosbox

have fun ig :p
